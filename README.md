#this is a readme file #here i'm going to give a little intro about myself

Introduction: I am Eman Nasir and i belong from Islamabad. I'm pursuing my masters degree here in SINES NUST. I've done my BSc from COMSATS University ISB in Bioinformatics. I've opted for the same program in masters level as well because i love how science and technology can work together to get desired results and make ife easier in medical field.

Interests: I am fond of reading and sometimes like to write as well. I love nature, therefore, i like to capture every moment that mesmerizes me. In short, reading and photography are my interests.

Learning: I really like how sines have designed our courses under MS Bioinformatics. I like how every course is linked with eachother to develop our understanding of this field. About this course, the highlited part is using GitHub, which has been tricky so far but an amazing skillset to develop. In short, sines is working well at developing skills.
