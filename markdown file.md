Learning outsomes:

We have covered the basic programming so far i.e; basics of lists, strings, functions, and some pseudocodes. All done in python which has laid a foundation for upcomming high level programming. 

what i'm still confused about are the scenario based questions and sometimes when autograder fails to mark my code green. :)
